# ASYT.ME - A Disaster Relief App
This proof-of-concept project was submitted to the HackUTA 2017 hackathon as a crowd-sourced tool to help those that are isolated in times of disaster. The project was awarded "Best Disaster Relief Project" - our project was inspired by the impact of Hurricane Harvey in Houston, TX.

This was built with HTML/JS/CSS, jQuery and the Google Maps API.

This project is a WIP, and will be refactored approx Jan. 2019.
